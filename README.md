# FoSE 2026 Replication Package

## Overview

This repository contains the replication package and supporting artifacts for the FoSE 2026 submission:

**“Be a Partner, Not a Bystander in Software Engineering Practice: Bridging the Gaps Between Academia and Industry.”**

The goal of this repository is to support transparency, reproducibility, and reuse by providing all data, analysis artifacts, and supporting materials required to reproduce the study’s findings.

## Repository Structure

The repository consists of the following key components:

* **AgreementAnalysis.ipynb** – Inter-rater agreement computation and analysis.
* **DataExplorer.ipynb** – Exploratory data analysis and dataset inspection.
* **RQ1.ipynb** – Analysis for Research Question 1.
* **data/** – All datasets, prompts, keyword lists, and annotated qualitative artifacts used in the study.

## Replication Instructions

To reproduce the results reported in the paper:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the Jupyter notebooks in the order relevant to your analysis goals.
3. Execute all cells in each notebook to regenerate the results.
4. Compare the generated outputs with the findings reported in the paper.

The notebooks are designed to be largely self-contained and include inline documentation where necessary.

## Requirements

* Operating System: macOS, Linux, or Windows
* Environment: Jupyter Notebook
* Python version and library dependencies are specified within the notebooks (or via a requirements file if added).
