192120549:I will bring the practice closer to research (or vice versa). The researchers will start solving actual problems in the community
192134556:Accept 2x more papers, each about half as long as they are currently. Papers are currently very dense and are optimized for reviews that obsess over minor questions. Switching to shorter papers (+ optional lengthy appendices) with lower quality bars and reserving longer presentation slots for top scoring works a la NeurIPS would substantially reduce reviewer burden, reduce stress for students, and give more power to the community to select impactful new ideas by “voting with their feet”. Awarding top works with more exposure would naturally incentivize doing more impactful work.
192164439:Focus on greater quality papers that have a positive impact to the software profession. This means reducing the pressure to publish constantly.
192178725:We should have a podcast to present the results of our research to software engineers.
192205474:I would invest seriously in outreach, creating bridges between researchers, practitioners, and broader audiences. This means recording and sharing talks, writing accessible summaries of papers, leveraging social media to reach a broader audience, and designing spaces where people outside academia can engage with current research. The outcome I'd like to see is a community that communicates its insights beyond conferences and papers, where practitioners apply our findings, researchers get richer feedback from the field, and ideas circulate more freely.
192305887:less publication-inflation, more freedom to collaborate with industry without having to ask for money from industry, less project proposal writing overhead (which mostly comes from the 10-15% acceptance rate for tax-funded research proposals)
192308195:Joint research and industrial conferences. Prioritize interesting ideas over novelty.
192495535:To increase the visibility of the SE community's results within the industry and the broader public. A benefit would be better and more impactful research.
192587847:More open-mindedness and less in-breeding toward within-community 'prestige games'. It would improve the real-world relevance, reach, and impact of research (here, in the real world, impact is not citations or 'top-ranked' publications).
192588908:I 'd like to see papers including the voice of small and medium software development organisations. It is ok to include the voice of developers from big/large companies such as Microsoft/Apple/Siemens.. but there are other sw developers outside creating great sw, and sometimes with more experience than the laters
192597855:All researchers must work a year in industry every decade
192626887:remove focus on papers and focus more on tools and have studies that evaluate/shed light on these tools. I would also value integration of solutions in the community.
192676762:be a partner not bystander in SE practice, to make more impact on practice
192718035:I would give more credits to system level research, solving problems in realistic setting. Unit level research is easier to get data and perform experiments, but we are too much oriented to unit-level research these days. Software Engineering was born from the necessity in practice. Margaret Hamilton wanted a solution to a problem she encountered in practice and that was the beginning of SE community. Paper publication should not be the final goal of research. Solving problems in real life should be the goal. After almost 60 years, the problem Margaret Hamilton wanted to solve is becoming bigger and more serious everywhere, but practitioners do not get enough help from SE community. I would like to see the community moving towards problem solving in practice, towards real solutions.
192723628:I do not want to read any more news about software failures. I would therefore like to have an easy-to-use method that would enable the development of correct software. And this method would be widespread and used by all software developers.
192731005:Amplifier the impact of our research
192757432:focus on improving how we manage software projects as more than half of failed software projects were 'poorly managed' (study by IBM)
192758693:Greater emphasis on the importance of replication. I would like to see journals in particular have sections for replicated studies because this is how science progresses. Not sure how they could be handled by conferences, but surely we can devise some way of giving researchers credit for such studies.
193659793:More creative ways to connect with other research areas. The interesting work is always at the intersection between fields, so letting our meetings (e.g. ICSE) 'bleed' into other areas should 'breed' some interesting new ideas.
193668599:Explore ways to highlight work that makes an impact on the SE industry
193757741:The excessive focus on rigor and big samples seems to have made it harder to connect with real practitioners through empirical studies. When developing new tools and techniques, industry best practice (e.g., the Y Combinator approach to startups or internal dev tools in FAANG) is to find pressing top of mind problems, build simple solutions and ship fast, and iterate to ensure solution really addresses problem. While SE research sometimes does all of these steps, through studies of practice, building solutions, and running lab studies, in reality there's often not sufficient fit to pressing problems, unrealistic assumptions, and limited context in evaluations that lead most in industry to ignore most SE research (with many important exceptions, largely done in partnership with industry research labs).
193795120:I would like the SE research community to be driven by 'functional requirements' expressed as some form of machine processable NL specifications, and the 'architectural requirements' expressed as another form of machine processable diagrammatic/NL specifications, especially now that AI (GenAI in particular) can play such a crucial role in each of the above, and the various SDLC phases built around the above two very crucial artifacts of enterprise businesses and IT systems respectively.
194004592:User-centered research that helps software engineers create better software
194711911:More focus on industrial impact of our research
195289566:We have to reposition software engineering as a strategic enabling discipline, explicitly recognised in research funding and policy frameworks. There should be sustained investment in foundational SE research, stronger alignment between academia and industry, and a visible narrative that links our work to digital sovereignty, sustainability, trustworthy AI, etc.
195756280:I would like to see more research on what are relevant problems/outcomes of interest for practitioners in different software engineering areas in the first place. Maybe just more research within the software industry, even if it is just a single case to better understand their reality. And then more researchers coordinating effort around investigating the impact of interventions (methods/tools/good practices) on such outcomes of interests and different contexts, so that we can help practitioners choose wisely such interventions, based on evidence.
195771332:Reduce focus on publication quantity and up quality. Raise the bar to publish thoughful insightful papers that might impact how software is actually engineered in the future
195774469:I would set up a journal aimed at a general audience, focusing on software and its societal impact. This would help to bridge the gap between software engineering and other research communities, stimulating broader cross-disciplinary collaboration.
195782001:Attract funding from industry
195910267:I wish more of our research was worthy of consideration by industry. When I worked in the pharmaceutical industry, there was enormous respect for academia. Industry folks read papers and discussed academic research all the time! In SE, industry doesn't even know we exist - and I think that's largely our own fault. Our writing isn't readable. Our topics aren't relevant. And our conclusions are not firm enough.
195962364:Better alignment with organisations who employ many software engineers and the challenges they face
196022630:We really need to work much harder on the ethical and societal impacts of software engineering and its aligned technologies (e.g. AI). I know this is not a hard core technical topic in and of itself, but it is critically important for society.
196030130:I would like to consider giving more recognition in the research tools developed and maintained as part of a research publication. For example, currently, we only have the most impactful paper award but not most impactful tool award.
196047077:More meaningful works that has real impact.
196061190:1. Add the number of reviewers for each top-conference and journal paper, say, from 3 to 5? 2. Limit the number of submissions per author per conference. 3. Value the practical impact and applicability of research, instead of the reported results.
196065027:Merge Research Tracks and Industry/SEIP Track into one, require all research papers to at least discuss practical relevance/provide a potential use case and require all industry papers to at least discuss how the state of the art is advanced
196065742:More industry attendants in conferences, closer dialog with a hope to produce more relevant research and, at least, systematic attention to the 'So what' question.
196065978:move away from the aspects mentioned above, that distract form producing systematically high quality software systems
196071446:I think our top priority should be to integrate industry more meaningfully into the community. For example, it’s great that ICSE automatically brings SEIP chairs onto the steering committee now, but many SEIP chairs are still academics. We should be giving actual practitioners real influence, not just symbolic roles. If we did that consistently, I think we’d get research that’s more grounded in real problems.
196071861:I would like to see SE applied to other domains, like networking domain (they are reimplementing the network stratum adopting ML approaches, but they do not care about the architecture, testing and so on). Also, classic topics should be re-oriented, but still be topic of research. Sustainable software engineering should be a priority due to the devastating effects of climate change. Variabilty management is decreasing the interest of the community although there are many open topics still under investigation. The community should appreciate what is pure SE instead of being impressed by AI or other out of topic papers.
196078058:Require everybody to make heavy use of their most recent invention for three months as a developer in actual industrial software development.
196144420:Giving much more attention to the impact on the industry (or to work in problems that the industry has identified).
196205708:A community where high-quality, durable artefacts and real-world impact are valued as much as novelty
196248189:No idea how to operationalize it, but a key problem is that there is no understanding of big problems, where different research adds pieces to together solve a large problem. (As opposed to AI which is more into building a body of knowledge which is a high hill) But this would require a deeper theory of the field as a foundation for combination.
196258379:Further impact, beyond papers
196290621:Rather than focusing on processes, I would like software engineers to focus on the competence profile of practitioners. How do I reliably assess whether a team is up to the task at hand, and what metrics can I use? This will be even more important as more teams will delegate to LLM-based tools.
196352856:The success of a research not measured primarly by h-index and citations, but by the contuinity of the work to solve a relevant problem. Ex. RSL and MSL have a high citations number, but what is the problem being solved?
196372137:I would make researchers interested in really supporting the practice and stop looking for low hanging fruits
196391274:I would shift the primary incentive from valuing incremental technical novelty to valuing sustained real-world impact or significance. This was something we briefly encouraged in venues like ICSE 2022, although the community has since shifted back toward novelty-driven evaluation. A renewed emphasis on robustness, reproducibility, long-term tool maintenance, and practical adoption as core contributions would motivate researchers to develop solutions that practitioners genuinely use, maintain artifacts beyond a single publication cycle, and conduct deeper empirical studies grounded in realistic settings. Over time, this would help the community produce work that is not only scientifically interesting but also durable, actionable, and truly beneficial to real software engineering practice.
196442734:Thoughtworks publishes the Technology Radar. InfoQ publishes their Trends Reports. Maybe a group from the SE research community could come up with something similar to show the research perspective.
196579032:There exists a fundamental mismatch between the SE community's goal and the industry's expectation. While the SE community is driven by genuine inquiry for knowledge, the industry might be driven by profit, cost reduction, and automation. We need to find a middle ground to ensure the meaningful co-existence of these two. Otherwise, the SE community might lose relevance over time.
