192144834:Different tracks in conferences give authors the opportunity to publish papers for different audiences and in different deadlines. The SE community tends to value the application of methods from other domains
192201982:Problem Domain. The problem statement is aligning with our day today lives.
192205474:There's a strong drive to rethink and modernize the discipline. New initiatives, collaborations, and paper formats are emerging that aim to make research more transparent, reproducible, and impactful. I especially value the openness to challenge established assumptions, experiment with new methodologies, and connect research with real industry problems. The collective energy to evolve the field is both inspiring and productive.
192250097:The community is very welcoming. I love this research field and the impact it has on industry.
192587927:The overall organization of networking activities and the ICSE conference this year has been truly outstanding. Over recent years, a number of new and promising initiatives have been introduced, reflecting the conference’s commitment to innovation and growth. As a result, ICSE is steadily becoming stronger and more robust across multiple dimensions, including the diversity of topics covered, the depth and direction of research, and the quality of discussions and collaborations it fosters. Moreover, the ICSE community itself is incredibly welcoming, supportive, and engaging. Interacting with colleagues here makes it clear that there is a tremendous amount of untapped potential within our research area—perhaps more so than in many other fields. This unexpressed potential represents an exciting opportunity: by continuing to nurture collaboration, encourage bold ideas, and push the boundaries of our research, the community can achieve even greater impact and excellence in the years to come.
192593186:I think that our field of research is cross-disciplinary, requiring different knowledge combined with other different fields. This is a particular aspects that implies an easy knowledge sharing between software engineering researchers. Moreover, a ground-level knowledge, such as Empirical Software Engineering is a common meeting point between researchers even if they come from different fields. This means that a researcher that applied an empirical method in a specific sector (e.g., a mining software repository study for quantum software engineering) can help also in other sector (e.g., applying the same method to LLM-based repositories).
192597855:researchers are aware of software problems
192723628:Developing new methods, techniques and tools for software engineering and evaluating them in restricted environments, doing experiments in industry
192731005:Being active and try to collaborate with industry partners
193795120:Research in point problems like Code generation/synthesis, Code verification, Debugging, Testing are more prominent, probably because the results are more easily verifiable, and are easily integrated in the SDLC.
195775809:Researchers frequently collaborate with companies like Google, Meta, Microsoft, Red Hat, and JetBrains. This will help them access large-scale real-world datasets, give the ability to validate research in practical settings, and help faster transfer of research innovations into tools and workflows.
195838608:diverse strengths and areas of research; the community is becoming inclusive of newcomers, great mentoring opportunities, new areas such as software in practice and software in society are gaining traction and support.
195860877:We publish fast and novel work, focusing on applicable use cases.
196009614:Welcoming community, interest from the industry
196051220:practicality of research
196053996:The quality of the reviews in top-tier conferences (e.g. ICSE) are generally much better than ML. Also, there's more of an emphasis on how the work can help people -- this is lacking with other fields.
196061195:I think we are doing lots of work on intelligent software engineering (especially appying & integrating & improving LLMs), these has helped improve developer efficiency a lot.
196070836:The SE community maintains close ties between researchers and practitioners in industry. Conferences such as ICSE, FSE, and ASE often include industry tracks and experience reports, ensuring that research problems are grounded in real-world needs. The SE community has matured in its use of empirical and evidence-based methods, such as controlled experiments, case studies, and mining software repositories. The SE community embraces a broad spectrum of topics, from human aspects (e.g., developer productivity and team dynamics) to AI-assisted programming, software testing, and security. Recent years have seen a push toward open science such as sharing data, code, and replication packages.
196071861:Empirical software engineering presenting experimental results. If you follow the scientific procedure, then how important are the hypothesis or results do not care, only care that you are showing many tables, graphics and figures, so the work is well validated. There are forums that like formalisms, although sometimes they are not applicable to any practical case in the industry, so if you use a formalism then your paper will be accepted. Now, papers using LLMs applied to SE are well accepted, but I envision that in the near future this kind of papers will be rejected (such as when papers reporting energy consumption of software were appreciated, but near later the community decided that were not important since the results could not be totally accurate).
196073766:1) Strong interdisciplinary collaboration The SE community is good at blending ideas from computer science, human–computer interaction, AI/ML, programming languages, and empirical methods. This helps produce research that is both technically rigorous and practically relevant. 2) Emphasis on empirical evidence The community has increasingly embraced large-scale empirical studies, replication work, and open datasets. This strengthens the credibility and reproducibility of published research. 3) Open science initiatives Many researchers now share datasets, tools, benchmarks, and replication packages. This culture of transparency accelerates progress and allows others to build on prior work more effectively. 4) High-quality flagship conferences Conferences like ICSE, FSE, and ASE, consistently maintain strong review processes, diverse program committees, and rigorous publication standards. They also provide excellent venues for networking and exposure to cutting-edge research.
196098374:Development of tools supporting SE, design automation, ideas for new practices, exchange of ideas, and application of artificial intelligence.
196113970:The SE community works particularly well where it embraces the space between pure theory and pure implementation. This is where methodological pluralism, empirical evidence, and engineering practice can meet.
196176584:open community, good publication models, connection to industry, good structure with conferences and journals, established field.
196208899:Large variety of topics, attention to practical applicability of contributions
196258379:The community works on relevant problems, part of the reasons is the interaction with industry-funded projects
196290840:High volume of papers, high attendance at conferences, (some) impact on industry practices
